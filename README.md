 This repository showcases a web-based form with enhanced 
validation capabilities. It ensures that users input valid data for fields like name, 
email, phone number, and password. The password validation includes a strength 
check, requiring a minimum length, uppercase and lowercase letters, a number, 
and a special character. The form provides real-time feedback, highlighting errors 
and guiding users to correct their inputs. Upon successful validation, a success 
message is displayed, confirming the form submission. This project serves as a 
valuable resource for developers looking to implement robust form validation  in 
their web applications.
